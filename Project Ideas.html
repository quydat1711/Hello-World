								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>This project will be focusing on designing a system to control computers and smart phones (with high-end front facing camera such as iPhone X(s)) with eye movement  and voice commands that is suitable for both normal people and the disabled. Possible use cases of this application would include: 
								<li>People with disabled hands using a computer or smart phone efficiently 
								<li>Users seeking free-hand experience
								<li>Gamers with console controller connected so they don’t have to switch to mouse and keyboard, thus increase usability and efficiency
								<li>Immersive Gaming experience	
								
								<h3>Motivation</h3> 
								<p>There are a fair amount of people who have misfunctioned or damaged parts of their body (hands particular in this case) due to war participation, genetic, illness, work injuries… Such people get limited to no access to modern technologies such as mobile phones, computers, TVs,… Not too long ago, I heard about RockyNoHands, a Twitch streamer - Youtuber who has his hands disabled after an injury in his neck but can play almost any game with only his mouth (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMvikz2cA-8)" target="_blank">Link</a>). Thus, I believe with up-to-date technology, doing things like this will be easier and more accessible for anyone in need.

								<h3>Description</h3>

								<p>Once purchased the Eye-tracking unit, the user (or someone else) will mount the unit on the bottom of the computer screen, download and setup the driver and control software, create a profile and calibrate the unit to work best with their eyes. 

								For smart phone users, we will give a list of compatible phone models and from there, users can download and install the suitable software. 

								This product includes 2 main parts:</p>

								<p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eye-tracking:</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the most accurate Eye-tracking tool on the market (Tobii) for PC and integrated front facing camera on phones to track precisely where the user is looking &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the screen. Key binds are as follow:
									<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Gaze to move pointer
									<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Right click (1 tap on phones): short blink
									<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Left click: long blink
									<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Toggle scroll mode: double blink and gaze up/down/left/right to scroll. Exit by a short blink
									<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Toggle click and drag: blink 1 eye

								<p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice control: </h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User can chose 2 modes of voice control:
									<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Activate voice control by closing eyes for 2 seconds
									<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Toggle by voice command (already available on many platforms such as: Cortana, Siri, Google Assistant,..)
									<p><br>When in a keyboard input zone, user can chose to input via an auto-popup on-screen keyboard or voice-to-text by activating voice command. This will be coded to work with Windows Speech Recognition and other smart assistant.
								</p>
											

								<H3>Tools and Technology</h3>
								<p>Hardware: This project will use Tobii Eye Tracker for PC users which is widely available for purchase. (<a href="https://gaming.tobii.com/product/tobii-eye-tracker-4c/">link</a>)
								<p>There are several phone models that has built-in infrared camera which will significantly increase the accuracy of eye tracking such as the iPhone X/Xs, Huawei Mate 20 Pro, One Plus 6T,… (<a href="https://beebom.com/10-best-smartphones-face-unlock-buy-right-now/">link</a>). Normal front facing camera would also work but the accuracy may vary between models and camera quality. 
								<p>Software: The code will be written in C++, there are open source packages and database available on Tobii's website for developers to use. (<a href="https://developer.tobii.com/">link</a>) 


								<h3>Skills Required</h3>
								<p>Programming:
									<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Control software for PC users including: Windows, Linux.
									<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Apps on IOS and Android
								<br>These software can be written in C++ 

								<p> Required devices of different platforms ready for testing and debugging.

								<p>Programing platform is available and free to use, devices of different models are quite easy to find as almost everyone has their own smartphone.

								<p>Some difficulties and drawbacks I may encounter when working on the project are:
									<li>Lack of programming knowledge
									<li>Cannot run tests on a wide range of devices, however, this can be done on the user's side such as create a forum to update which model works or if there is any &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bugs
									<li>Funding issue
									<li>Have to rely on third party hardware
									<li>Not everyone can afford the Tobii eye tracking
									
									

								<p><br>If possible, we can expand the project further and start researching on our dedicated eye-tracking device that is more affordable for everyone. 



								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								Compared to the mouth control joystick approach (RockyNoHands), this project deliver much simpler commands and focus on day to day use, however, it's more accessible, simple to setup, easier to learn and get used to in a short amount of time. If this project is successful, there will be more opportunities for those who are less fortunate. They will be able to find a suitable job and work from home which can be a reliable source of income, thus decrease social liability. The Eye movement data can be stored and used in researches to enhance tracking precision hence improving user's experience. This technology can also be implemented alongside conventional methods (touch, keyboard and mouse) and change the way we interact with computer and mobile phones by making predictions and suggestions to the user.
